# global instructions

## code style

- use lowercase for all comments
- keep code simple, avoid over-engineering, functionally should be the same
- prefer readability over cleverness
- no emojis
- no em dashes

## javascript/typescript

- always use bun instead of npm/yarn/npx (bun install, bun run, bunx)

## python

- use uv for everything: uv run, uv pip, uv venv
- use `hf` cli instead of `huggingface-cli` (deprecated)

## bash

- avoid commands that cause output buffering issues
- do not pipe output through `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `more` when monitoring or checking command output
- do not use `| head -n X` or `| tail -n X` to truncate output - these cause buffering problems
- instead, let commands complete fully, or use `--max-lines` flags if the command supports them
- for log monitoring, prefer reading files directly rather than piping through filters
- run commands directly without pipes when possible
- if you need to limit output, use command-specific flags (e.g., `git log -n 10` instead of `git log | head -10`)
- avoid chained pipes that can cause output to buffer indefinitely

## git commits

- use conventional commit prefixes: feat, fix, docs, refactor, chore, test, style
- lowercase only (including the prefix)
- one-liner describing what was implemented
- no signatures or co-authored-by lines
- commit after completing each task

## behavior

### assumption surfacing

before implementing anything non-trivial, state assumptions:

```
ASSUMPTIONS:
1. [assumption]
2. [assumption]
-> correct me now or i'll proceed with these.
```

never silently fill in ambiguous requirements.

### confusion management

when encountering inconsistencies or unclear specs:

1. stop - do not guess
2. name the specific confusion
3. ask the clarifying question
4. wait for resolution

bad: silently picking one interpretation
good: "i see X in file A but Y in file B - which takes precedence?"

### change summaries

after modifications, summarize:

```
CHANGES MADE:
- [file]: [what changed and why]

NOT TOUCHED:
- [file]: [why left alone]

CONCERNS:
- [risks or things to verify]
```

### worktree workflow

when starting a non-trivial task (not config tweaks, not quick fixes):

1. determine a short descriptive name from the task (e.g., `auth-fix`, `add-search`)
2. create a worktree: `git worktree add ../$(basename $PWD)-<name> -b claude/<name>`
3. cd into the new worktree directory
4. do all work there
5. when done, tell the user the branch name and worktree path

skip worktree creation if:

- already in a worktree (check: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` differs from `git worktree list` main)
- the task is trivial (single file edit, config change)
- the user explicitly says to work on the current branch

## failure modes to avoid

1. making assumptions without checking
2. not managing confusion - guessing instead of asking
3. not surfacing inconsistencies
4. being sycophantic ("of course!" to bad ideas)
5. overcomplicating code and APIs
6. not cleaning up dead code after refactors
7. modifying code orthogonal to the task
8. removing things you don't fully understand

## philosophy

the human is monitoring in an IDE - they see everything and will catch mistakes. minimize mistakes they need to catch while maximizing useful work.

you have unlimited stamina, the human does not. loop on hard problems, but don't loop on the wrong problem because you failed to clarify the goal.

## don'ts

- don't add features that weren't requested (but you can suggest them)
- don't refactor unrelated code
- don't add documentation unless asked

## principles

### research

- for all the principles below always use nia to research and index documents when needed
- use nia mcp as ground truth source

### scaling

- validate at small scale before scaling up
- run a sub-minute version first to verify the full pipeline works
- when scaling, only the scale parameter should change

### systems-first

for complex features, iterate on the system design before writing code:

- what are the boundaries? what should each component know/not know?
- what are the invariants? what must always be true?
- how does this decompose? what's the natural structure?

don't fill architectural gaps with generic patterns - go back and forth until the design is clear. implementation is the easy part.

### constraint-persistence

- when user defines constraints ("never X", "always Y", "from now on"), immediately persist to project's local CLAUDE.md
- acknowledge, write, confirm
